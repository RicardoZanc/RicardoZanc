### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricardo Zancan da Costa, i live in Brazil and my current goal is working with development.
Nowadays i'm studying C#, although i've already made my first CRUD using Node.js and PostgreSQL for backend and React.Js for frontend, that project was made as a test in a course i've recently finished.
