# Welcome

## - My name is Ricardo Zancan da Costa 
## - I live in Brazil and my current goal is working with development.

### Nowadays i'm studying C#, although i've already made two projects using JavaScript:

- A CRUD using Node.js and PostgreSQL for backend and React.Js for frontend, that project was made as a test in a course i've recently finished.
